# Spring Boot System Design: Build One Product, One Step at a Time

Learn Java, Spring Boot, architecture, Docker, and distributed systems by evolving one deliberately small backend: **ParcelPilot**.

ParcelPilot is a parcel-delivery tracking service. A customer creates a delivery; an operator moves it through states such as `CREATED`, `PICKED_UP`, and `DELIVERED`; a notification is eventually sent. It is familiar, small enough for `curl`, and naturally grows from one Java file into a monolith and then a few services.

This is a **backend-only** curriculum. Each step should:

1. introduce one main idea;
2. make one observable improvement to ParcelPilot;
3. run locally, preferably in Docker; and
4. be demonstrable with a command-line request.

Start with [PROJECT-STORY.md](PROJECT-STORY.md), then follow [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md). [Topic instructions](topics/README.md) explain the repeated problem → lesson → build → verify flow. References are deep dives, not extra work to finish first.

## Prerequisites

- A terminal and editor
- Docker Desktop
- JDK 21 (recommended)
- `curl`

Maven can be installed locally, but every Maven build later runs inside a container too. See [references/maven.md](references/maven.md).

## Product scope

Do not add users, a frontend, payments, or cloud deployment while learning the core path. Use simple hard-coded data first. Complexity is added only when the current design has a concrete limitation.
